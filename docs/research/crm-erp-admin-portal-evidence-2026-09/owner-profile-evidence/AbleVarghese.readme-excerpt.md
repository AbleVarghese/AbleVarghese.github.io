**The short version:** a decade of banking-grade fintech (CIBC, Interac-member payment rails),
converted into an **agentic AI engineering system** that lets one person deliver what teams
deliver. Everything on this page is live, running software, and every number on it is
computed from git history, not claimed.

**Now:** Application Systems Analyst at an Interac-member fintech · Founder, Toronto 🇨🇦

**Say hello:** architecture, agentic engineering, fintech → **able.varghese@hotmail.com**

## Platforms I've built and operate

| Platform | What it is | Under the hood |
|---|---|---|
| **[Licentric](https://licentric.com)** | Software licensing and monetization, from license keys to AI-agent tokens. 3 minutes to first validation vs. hours on incumbents | Ed25519 offline-first signed licenses · declarative Stripe→license mapping (zero webhook code) · Python SDK on PyPI · TypeScript |

| **[Keralora](https://keralora.com)** | Invite-only B2B spice-trade platform, Kerala to Canada, with complete buyer↔seller anonymity | Three-wall anonymity architecture (DAL + Postgres RLS + document redaction) · anonymity test suite in CI |

## Published research

**[The Provenance-First Wiki](https://github.com/AbleVarghese/Provenance-First-Wiki)** · August 2026 · [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.21862190](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21862190)

*Why the LLM wiki pattern breaks past a thousand files, and the five invariants that fix it.*

A design paper answering Andrej Karpathy's [llm-wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f)
pattern with the case it cannot survive at scale. 310 catalogued sources across information retrieval,
agent memory, archival science, and cognitive psychology. Eight candidate architectures scored under
locked weights (pairwise consistency ratio 0.009), a 20,000-run Monte Carlo sensitivity sweep,
failure-mode analysis, minimax regret, and an analysis of competing hypotheses. The full decision
record is published with the paper, including the section stating when you should ignore it.

## Engineering infrastructure I built to build them

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/system-dark.svg">
  <img alt="Diagram: one engineer operates an agentic engineering system of orchestration doctrine, adaptive concurrency, live fleet monitoring, self-hosted CI and data supply, which ships ten production platforms. 12,424 commits, about 3,881 hours, COCOMO-priced at about 543 person-years." src="assets/system-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture>

The machine that builds the products:

- **Multi-agent orchestration doctrine**: model-tiered routing (reason/build/research), adaptive concurrency with circuit breakers, orchestrator-gated acceptance where no agent's work merges until independently re-verified
- **Scrapos**: standalone data-supply engine. 73 scrapers, queue-based pipeline, self-healing, drift-gated auto-redeploy
- **SwitchboardOS**: control plane for LLM cost, observability, and agent governance
- **[ops-dashboard](https://github.com/AbleVarghese/ops-dashboard)**: zero-dependency live SDLC monitor that watches every project's agents, tests, and git state simultaneously over SSE. **Open source (MIT)**
- **local-gitlab**: fully self-hosted GitLab CE + runner. $0/month CI/CD any project plugs into
- **Relay**: portable partner-marketing engine (attribution, commissions, payouts) that integrates with any product from zero code upward
- **[ios-claude-toolkit](https://github.com/AbleVarghese/ios-claude-toolkit)**: 22 battle-tested Claude Code skills for iOS, distilled from 75+ production sessions. **Open source (MIT)**
- **Flowen**: iOS money-transfer app. Swift 6, MVVM, **3,349 test methods**, 9-stage CI pipeline
- **Devrule.ai**: enterprise AI-rules middleware that validates code changes against configurable rules before AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) can execute them. Multi-tenant RLS, Stripe billing, 40+ test suites
- **Dwellium**: trust-first hotel booking platform. NestJS monorepo, **469K lines** across web, mobile, and backend, Amadeus + Stripe integration
- **estate-network**: the machine layer under all of it. One repo, three deployment targets (Mac mini, laptops, router), 10 scheduled jobs, install scripts per target, so no critical automation depends on any one machine being awake

## The portfolio, measured

*Computed from git history across 21 repositories. Script and methodology published here
([`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/METHODOLOGY.md)): every number is checkable.*

  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/stats-dark.svg">
  <img alt="5.85M lines delivered, 10 platforms shipped, about 543 COCOMO person-years. 12,424 commits, 1.86M lines in production, 2,479 test files, 777K doc lines. 293 active days, about 3,881 hours, 48 percent between 5pm and 2am" src="assets/stats-light.svg" width="100%">
</picture>

COCOMO-81 prices this codebase at **~543 person-years**. One person shipped it in ~3,881 hours.
**That multiplier is the point.**

*The public ledger only. 2014–2023 adds an estimated **5,000+ commits across 20+ enterprise
projects** (teams of 1 to 37), confidential by contract, much of it in corporate systems that
never touched GitHub.*

are a floor and tall bars are batch landings. Aug '26 is a partial month. Every chart on this page

## Before this

**Interac-member fintech**, Application Systems Analyst: BASE24 / HP NonStop transaction processing, AI-agent orchestration for internal tooling
**CIBC** (4 yrs), Senior Application Engineer: architected and shipped five banking applications to production; Java/Python; CI/CD with IBM UrbanCode; Scrum Master; led the Drive Smart iOS/Android app team as PM; built an internal application platform and CMS used across Solutions, Development, QA, Build and Production teams
**StrongBase Capital**, securities and options trader: quantitative strategies, Greeks-based risk management
**Spine Hedge** (2021–), AI-powered fintech project: the bridge between my trading years and the platform portfolio above
**Earlier**: Mechanical Engineering @ Carleton · Software Engineering @ Centennial · NASA CanSat & Lunabotics team lead · conference speaker on engineering entrepreneurship

*All enterprise, corporate, and client work delivered since 2014 remains private and confidential,
by contract and by principle. Everything public here is my own, built outside it. The discipline
underneath came from those years.*

## How I work

TDD-first · spec-before-code · structural fixes over patches · one source of truth · evidence
before conclusions. Codified as machine-enforced rules my agent fleets follow.
**Quality is a system property, not a habit.**
